Test task for Unreal Engine

General tasks:
-The player and opponent must have a health points, the ability to take and deal damage. The enemy must die when the health runs out. The current health mechanic is enough for the player, the death mechanic is not necessary.
-The enemy must have a weapon with a limited ammo in the magazine/clip. The enemy's total ammo is not important.

Enemy objectives:
-Notice the enemy (player) and switch from standby mode to aggressive mode.
-Take aim at the enemy with a weapon.
-Find cover for safe firing. Fire from the spot if there is no cover.
-Find and retreat to cover to reload weapons.

Plus tasks:
-The ability of opponents to belong to different groups and fight among themselves.
-A set of behavioral tactics: “aggressive attack”, “defense of a point”, “complete retreat”.
-Weight mechanics for choosing tactics. Depending on the characteristics (health counter, distance to the player/enemy, etc.), the enemy must choose the appropriate tactics.
